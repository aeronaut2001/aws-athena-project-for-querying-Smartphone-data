JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) are both API (Application Programming Interface) specifications that provide a standardized way for applications to interact with databases.

1. JDBC:
   - JDBC is a Java API that enables Java applications to interact with databases. It provides a set of classes and interfaces in the Java programming language for executing SQL (Structured Query Language) statements.
   - JDBC allows Java programs to connect to a wide range of databases such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc., by providing a common interface for database connectivity.
   - JDBC works by using JDBC drivers, which are specific to each database. These drivers act as intermediaries between Java applications and databases, translating JDBC calls into database-specific commands.
   - JDBC drivers can be categorized into four types: JDBC-ODBC bridge drivers, native-API partly Java driver, network protocol drivers, and thin drivers.

2. ODBC:
   - ODBC is a standard API for accessing database management systems (DBMS). It is a C-based API that allows applications to access data in database management systems that use SQL as a query language.
   - ODBC provides a standard interface between an application and a DBMS, allowing applications to be independent of the specific DBMS being used.
   - ODBC works through ODBC drivers, which are provided by database vendors. These drivers translate ODBC function calls into commands that the DBMS understands.
   - ODBC drivers are available for a wide range of database systems, including Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.
   
While both JDBC and ODBC serve the same purpose of providing a standardized interface for database access, JDBC is specific to Java applications, whereas ODBC is more widely used across various programming languages and platforms, including C, C++, Python, etc.
